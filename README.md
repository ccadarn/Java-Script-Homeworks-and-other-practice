# Welcome to My Coding Journey

## Update 0  0.2023

This serves as my training ground, where I periodically upload my homework as I continue to learn and progress in whichever direction I end up pursuing.

I decided to delve into coding in 2023 through **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)**, and so far, the process has been satisfying with its inevitable highs and lows. I've come to the realization that knowledge without practical application is a futile endeavor.

Hence, I've employed AI and other websites to find homework assignments as a means of reinforcing the new topics I've acquired. This decision came rather belatedly, as I discovered that despite advancing significantly in my course, I now find myself starting anew to establish a solid foundation. This groundwork is essential to facilitate smoother and swifter progress in the future.

To be honest, the first week of homework has provided me with a much deeper understanding of JavaScript than I gained in the last six months. Despite having grasped the basics through Codecademy, the lack of practical application made it challenging to retain all that knowledge.

## Update 1 01.2024

Currently reading **[EloquentJS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)**; at the end of the chapter, it has some tasks to practice JS, so the latest update will contain a new file named **eloquentHM.js**.

## Update 2 01.2024

Continuing to study using Codecademy; right now, I need to wrap my head around **Promises** and async functions. To understand the topic, I had to ask AI for a task to practice it. You can read comments in the new file **promiseHM.js** to understand it. Even though I failed most of the tasks in the end, it clarified many of the problems I had with Promises, so it was not in vain.

## Update 3 01.2024

Discovered the concept of **closure** in JavaScript and realized that despite my extensive learning in JavaScript, I still struggled to comprehend it. This challenge became apparent when attempting to solve **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** problems, where closure seemed to be a recurring theme. However, it's never too late to grasp new concepts. The latest update incorporates some hands-on practice with closure. Additionally, I've made the decision to segment my tasks, uploading each homework concept separately for better clarity.

PS: Two days following the completion of tasks related to **closure** and ongoing reading of **EloquentJS**, I've **FINALLY** understood the concept! ^^

## Update 4 01.2024

New update includes tasks that were assigned on **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)**; this platform is excellent for honing coding skills, not limited to just JavaScript. Honestly, I now recognize a definite improvement in my coding abilities. A few months ago, I wouldn't have known where to start. Despite the mistakes I **still** make while crafting solutions, at least I am not entirely lost, as I was in the beginning ^^

## Update 5 01.2024

- Added new folders **AIGeneratedHW** to clean up repository.
- Added **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** folder not only to track my progress, but also it is great for future reference and it is much more easier to write code in VSC.
- Completed several tasks in **CodeWars** and **LeetCode** folders.

## Update 6 02.2024

New month, new update ^^

- Chapter four of **[EloquentJS](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)** book is finished, in the process of solving the tasks at the end of it.
  - PS: while doing it learned about new concept **"Nullish coalescing operator (??)"**
- Completed several of **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** challenges.
- Found new website **[CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com/)** where you can practice code while playing games, but need more time to figure it out ^^.
- Right now focusing on completing my course at **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)** so there might be less updates this month.

## Update 7 05.2024

Found new job so been off grid for a couple of months so no homework done.
Currently want to complete Odin project but so far the progress is very slow.
Trying to so start doing homework in JS again...

- Added **[ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/)** folder with new website that provides mathematical problems to try and solve them using JS code.

## Update 8 07.2025

Despite the fact that almost a year passed since my last update, I am still stuck learning JS. I am lacking motivation.
New job that I found last year is related to techical support and I found that QA feld is where I want to go.

Trying to start doing some projects in the hope that it will make me move forward...
