# Welcome to My Coding Journey!

## Update 0  0.2023
This serves as my training ground, where I periodically upload my homework as I continue to learn and progress in whichever direction I end up pursuing.

I decided to delve into coding in 2023 through **Codecademy**, and so far, the process has been satisfying with its inevitable highs and lows. I've come to the realization that knowledge without practical application is a futile endeavor.

Hence, I've employed AI to generate homework assignments as a means of reinforcing the new topics I've acquired. This decision came rather belatedly, as I discovered that despite advancing significantly in my course, I now find myself starting anew to establish a solid foundation. This groundwork is essential to facilitate smoother and swifter progress in the future.

To be honest, the first week of homework has provided me with a much deeper understanding of JavaScript than I gained in the last six months. Despite having grasped the basics through Codecademy, the lack of practical application made it challenging to retain all that knowledge.

## Update 1 01.2024
Currently reading **"Eloquent JS"**; at the end of the chapter, it has some tasks to practice JS, so the latest update will contain a new file named __eloquentHM.js__.

## Update 2 01.2024
Continuing to study using Codecademy; right now, I need to wrap my head around **Promises** and async functions. To understand the topic, I had to ask AI for a task to practice it. You can read comments in the new file __promiseHM.js__ to understand it. Even though I failed most of the tasks in the end, it clarified many of the problems I had with Promises, so it was not in vain.

## Update 3 01.2024
Discovered the concept of __closure__ in JavaScript and realized that despite my extensive learning in JavaScript, I still struggled to comprehend it. This challenge became apparent when attempting to solve LeetCode problems, where closure seemed to be a recurring theme. However, it's never too late to grasp new concepts. The latest update incorporates some hands-on practice with closure. Additionally, I've made the decision to segment my tasks, uploading each homework concept separately for better clarity.

PS: Two days following the completion of tasks related to __closure__ and ongoing reading of **"Eloquent JS,"** I've FINALLY understood the concept! ^^

## Update 4 01.2024
New update includes tasks that were assigned on **Codewars**; this platform is excellent for honing coding skills, not limited to just JavaScript. Honestly, I now recognize a definite improvement in my coding abilities. A few months ago, I wouldn't have known where to start. Despite the mistakes I __still__ make while crafting solutions, at least I am not entirely lost, as I was in the beginning ^^
