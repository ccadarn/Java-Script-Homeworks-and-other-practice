This serves as my training ground, where I will periodically upload my homework as I continue to learn and progress in whichever direction I end up pursuing. 
I decided to delve into coding this year through Codecademy, and so far, the process has been satisfying with its inevitable highs and lows. 
I've come to the realization that knowledge without practical application is a futile endeavor.

Hence, I've employed AI to generate homework assignments as a means of reinforcing the new topics I've acquired. 
This decision came rather belatedly, as I discovered that despite advancing significantly in my course, I now find myself starting anew to establish a solid foundation. 
This groundwork is essential to facilitate smoother and swifter progress in the future.

To be honest, the first week of homework has provided me with a much deeper understanding of JavaScript than I gained in the last six months. 
Despite having grasped the basics through Codecademy, the lack of practical application made it challenging to retain all that knowledge.
